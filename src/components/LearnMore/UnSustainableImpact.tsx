          Living Unsustainably: The Consequences
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Unsustainable practices and a lack of eco-friendly living have significant consequences
          on our environment, public health, and future generations. In the Philippines and around
          the world, we are seeing the real impact of this through deforestation, water
          insecurity, air pollution, and deteriorating living conditions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">
          For example, from 2002 to 2023, the Philippines lost 190 thousand hectares of humid
          primary forest — a 4.1% decrease. At the same time, over 60 million Filipinos lack access
          to safe water and 43 million lack access to safe toilets. Meanwhile, Metro Manila is
          experiencing dangerously high PM2.5 air pollution levels, primarily due to traffic
          emissions and outdated public transport systems like PUJs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">
          These outcomes are not isolated events — they are the result of unchecked urbanization,
          weak environmental regulations, and failure to prioritize sustainability in our daily
          lives and governance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base mb-6">
          It is crucial to recognize these issues and take steps toward more sustainable living and
          policies that protect our environment, improve public health, and ensure a livable future
          for all.

          This graph shows the change in global surface temperature compared to the long-term
          average from 1951 to 1980. Earth’s average surface temperature in 2024 was the warmest on
          record since recordkeeping began in 1880 (source: NASA/GISS). Overall, Earth was about
          1.47°C warmer in 2024 than in the late 19th-century (1850–1900) preindustrial average.
          The 10 most recent years are the warmest on record.
